# Registration (Proposal)
1. Select the reference pose by smallest sum of reprojection error of subset images
    - Implement reprojection error calculation
2. Get the reference pose (trivial)


# Verification Steps

1. Visualise Pcd (Coarse)

2. Visualise Line Projection
    - Project line drawn on model_A to images of model_B

3. Hover camera of model_A over model_B
